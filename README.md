##**Approach:**

- Preprocessing genotype data into machine-learning–friendly formats.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Training classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluating model accuracy and feature importance.
- Generating predictions and visualizations.

##**Repository Structure**

- prepare_genotype_data*.py → Scripts for preprocessing genotype datasets.
- train_model1.py, trainmodel.py → Scripts for training ML models.
- logistic_regression_model.pkl, random_forest_model.pkl → Saved trained models.
- visualization.py → Visualization of feature importance and results.
- feature_importance.png → Visual representation of important genetic features.
- X_train_preprocessed.csv, X_test_preprocessed.csv → Preprocessed input data.
- y_train.csv, y_test.csv → Labels for training and testing.
- predictions.csv → Model predictions on test data.

##**Methods & Tools**

- Languages/Frameworks: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
- Genomic Data: Encoded SNP/genotype datasets.

##**Key Insights**

- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models can predict disease risk from genomic data.
- Feature importance analysis helps identify SNPs most strongly associated with disease traits.
- Preprocessing steps (e.g., encoding, cleaning) are critical for accurate predictions.

##**Future Directions**

- Extend to larger-scale GWAS datasets.
- Apply deep learning models for higher prediction accuracy.
- Integrate pharmacogenomics knowledge bases (PharmGKB, ClinVar) for drug–gene interactions.
